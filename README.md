Previously, I was a Cloud ML Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I built GenAI + RAG architecture integrating AWS Bedrock to support natural language queries. Additionally, I was Software Engineer / Research Intern at the NASA Johnson Space Center, where I worked on wireless networking infra to establish Wi-Fi and cellular communication (3GPP) on the Moon. At NASA, I also conducted Astrobee research on spacecraft signal propagation (First Author NASA publication in IEEE WiSEE) 🚀 View more on my [website](https://www.everestyang.com/)!
