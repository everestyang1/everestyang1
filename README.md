## Hi there 👋, I'm Everest Yang
I am currently an undergraduate student at Brown University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.

Currently, I am a *Software Engineer Intern* at **Zeta Surgical**, a Series A startup (YC S19) focused on Surgical Robotics. I am building C++ XR neurosurgical navigation and focused ultrasound systems, combining 3D anatomical modeling, wave simulations, and robotics optimization. I also interned as a *Hardware Engineer* for a few months 🤖

Previously, I was a *Software Engineer Intern* at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, where I built a Generative AI application using AWS Bedrock, enabling natural-language queries over structured and unstructured operational data via S3, Lambda, Glue, Athena, and OpenSearch. I also earned four AWS certifications (SAA, MLE, AIP, CP) ⛅️ 

Additionally, I was *Research Engineer Intern* at the **NASA Johnson Space Center**, where I worked on wireless networking infra to establish Wi-Fi and cellular communication (3GPP) on the Moon. At NASA, I also conducted Astrobee research on spacecraft signal propagation (First Author NASA publication in IEEE WiSEE) 🚀
